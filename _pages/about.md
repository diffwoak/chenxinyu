I'm a first year graduate student from the [School of Computer Science](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). My research interests include machine learning and privacy-preserving computation. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zheng Peijia](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/ZhengPeijia) of the School of Computer Science at Sun Yat-sen University.
